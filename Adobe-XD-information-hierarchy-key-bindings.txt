A link from a page that leads to the same page means the page refreshes.
All links in Adobe XD Prototype are associated with the action 'Tap' (e.g. clicking on a button) execpt the key bindings shown below:

For All Pages:
Show Nav Bar switch courses options page - N
Show Nav Bar view options page - Shift + N
Show Nav Bar create options page - Ctrl + N
All tabs of the Nav Bar are clickable in these pages (in other pages the Nav Bar tabs aren't clickable) so you can check out the Home, Contact Us
and the Switch Courses/View/Create options.
I used keyboard shortcuts since in Adobe XD you can't link pages through hovering (only tapping, dragging and keybinds).
